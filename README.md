# Wp-Uploadcare

In this repository, I store the scripts required for various functions using Uploadcare. 
The Cleanup.php script will clean a Uploadcare storage. 
The download.php script will download all the files in a storage. It will create a new folder in the direcotry where the script is hosted and download all files once. 
To use these scripts, you must enter your Uploadcare public ans secret key inside the config.php
